# Image Reconstruction from multiple OCT Partial Images
 Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical imaging method. It can be considered analogous to ultrasound imaging with greater resolution but lower penetration depth. OCT cannot penetrate the tooth fully to observe tooth decay in-between teeth, since this area cannot be accessed directly, unlike with X-rays. This project attempts to reconstruct a 3D image of a tooth from partial 2D images taken from the side of a tooth which are normally accessible. Various techniques were explored both in terms of image capture and image registration.
